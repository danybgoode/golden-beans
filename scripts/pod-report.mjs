// pod-report · Sprint 2, Story 2.1. This is the I/O half: it runs git and gh against a LOCAL
// medusa-bonsai checkout, hands the result to the pure `lib/pod-metrics.mjs` computation, and
// pushes the artifact through the same client-pushes rail Sprint 1 built.
//
//   node scripts/pod-report.mjs --repo ~/dobby/medusa-bonsai            # print the artifact
//   node scripts/pod-report.mjs --repo … --push                        # push it to the engine

// see lib/pod-metrics.mjs's NOT_INSTRUMENTED list, which travels INSIDE the artifact so a renderer
// cannot drop the caveats. The dataset supports none of them, and a fabricated 0% change-failure
// rate would be the most flattering number on the page and the least true.
//
// ── Determinism ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `--generated-at` exists so a rerun can produce a byte-identical artifact (Sprint 2's headline
// acceptance criterion). Without it the timestamp is the only field that differs between runs, and
// a determinism check that ignores one field is not a determinism check.
