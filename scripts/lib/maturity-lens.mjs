// maturity-lens.mjs — places a pod on the published Steps-of-AI-Adoption ladder.
//
// pod-report · Sprint 2, Story 2.4. Pure, sibling of `pod-metrics.mjs`: every function here takes
// already-gathered evidence and returns a value. No git, no network, no clock, no imports beyond
// node builtins (in fact: no imports at all). That is what makes "rerun from the same inputs ⇒
// byte-identical maturity section" testable, and it is inherited straight from 2.1's determinism
// spec (see sprint-2.md Story 2.4 acceptance).
//
// ── The five rules this file exists to enforce (sprint-2.md, Story 2.4 + README amendment) ──────
//
// 1. EVIDENCE IS REQUIRED FOR EVERY `met` ROW, STRUCTURALLY. `makeCriterionRow` below has no
//    `status` parameter — status is DERIVED from whether an evidence pointer was handed in. A
//    scorer literally cannot produce a `met` row without a real evidence object, because there is
//    no code path that sets status to `met` any other way. This is the acceptance criterion "the
//    renderer is structurally incapable of an unevidenced claim", implemented at the one chokepoint
//    every row passes through.
// 2. THREE STATES ONLY: `met` · `not_met` · `not_instrumented`. `makeCriterionRow` is the only
//    place a status string is written, and it only ever writes one of these three.
// 3. THE VERDICT AND THE NOT-INSTRUMENTED COUNT COME FROM ONE FUNCTION, ONE OBJECT. `scoreVerdict`
//    returns `{ step, stepLabel, metCriteria, totalCriteria, notInstrumentedCount }` as a single
//    return value — there is no way to read `step` off a call that didn't also compute
//    `notInstrumentedCount`, so a caller cannot render the score while dropping the coverage gap
//    that qualifies it.
// 4. EVERY DERIVED ROW STATES ITS PROXY NATURE. Every criterion here is inferred from git/PR shape
//    (a trailer, a check name, a timestamp overlap) — none of it is direct observation of intent or
//    quality. `proxyNote` is a required field on every row, met or not.
// 5. A DELIBERATELY LOW-MATURITY FIXTURE MUST SCORE LOW. `scoreVerdict` starts at step 0 and only
//    rises off zero if at least one criterion is actually `met` — an all-empty or all-failing input
//    cannot be nudged to "Assisted" by the absence of data. See maturity-lens.test.mjs.
//
// ── Expected input shape (the gatherer's contract; not enforced at runtime — missing fields render
//    the affected criterion `not_instrumented`, never crash) ─────────────────────────────────────
//   {
//     prs: [{
//       number, createdAt, mergedAt, closedAt,
//       reviewComments: [{ isAgentReviewer }],   // automated_code_review
//       ciCheckNames: ['lint', 'test', ...],     // code_quality_enforcement
//       ciPassedBeforeMerge: boolean,            // trusted_self_verification_loop

//     }],
//     commits: [{ date, agentCoAuthored, isRevert }],
//     hasClaudeMd: boolean,
//     skillsProvenance: [{ plugin, ref }],
//   }
//
// ── Not derivable, and why (fixed for v1 — see sprint-2.md's "Rendered not instrumented" list) ───
// These six never touch `prs`/`commits`/`hasClaudeMd` at all: no shape of git/PR evidence answers
// them, so they are declared gaps rather than criteria that could theoretically fail to be met.
// Each is also a guardrail named on the ladder itself — the upsell IS the honest gap.
