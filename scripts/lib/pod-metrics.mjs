// pod-report · Sprint 2, Story 2.1. Pure: every function here takes already-gathered data and

//
// ── The amendment this file implements (Daniel, 2026-07-25) ───────────────────────────────────
// The epic originally promised "human-baseline era vs agent-augmented era of the SAME repo". That
// comparison is not computable: medusa-bonsai is agent-native from its first commit (75% of June's
// commits carry a Claude co-author trailer, 86% of July's, 691 of 846 overall). There is no
// human-majority era to baseline against.
//
// So the baseline is PUBLISHED BENCHMARKS — our numbers computed, theirs cited — and anything the
// data cannot support renders as **not instrumented**, never as a zero. That distinction is the
// whole ethic of this epic: a fabricated 0% change-failure-rate would be the most flattering
// number on the page and the least true.
//
// NOT INSTRUMENTED, and why — each one is also a guardrail a pods engagement installs:
//   · velocity (points/sprint)     — story points do not exist anywhere in the dataset
//   · cost per shipped point       — no points, and no token/cost ledger
//   · change failure rate          — 0 true `git revert` commits in 846; no rollback mechanism
//   · failed-deployment recovery   — no incident record to measure against
//   · story-level throughput       — no per-story ship event (mb's own rail hardcodes it empty)
